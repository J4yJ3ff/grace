## Step 4: Set Up MongoDB

### Local MongoDB Instance

1. Ensure MongoDB is running on your machine.
2. The application will automatically create the database when it first connects.

### MongoDB Atlas

1. Create a new project and cluster in MongoDB Atlas.
2. Set up a database user with read/write permissions.
3. Add your IP address to the IP access list.
4. Copy your connection string and add it to the `.env` file.

## Step 5: Set Up Stripe

1. Create a Stripe account if you don't have one.
2. Get your API keys from the Stripe Dashboard.
3. Set up webhook endpoints:
   - Go to **Developers > Webhooks** in your Stripe Dashboard.
   - Add an endpoint with the URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe` (use `http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe` for local development with Stripe CLI).
   - Select the following events:
     - `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret and add it to your `.env` file.

---

## Step 6: Set Up Email Provider

1. Set up an account with an SMTP provider.
2. Get your SMTP credentials and add them to your `.env.local` file.
3. If using Resend for receipt emails, get your API key and add it to your `.env.local` file.

---

## Step 7: Start the Development Server

Start the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Step 8: Create an Admin User

1. Visit [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin).
2. Follow the prompts to create your first admin user.
3. Use this account to access the Payload CMS admin panel.

1. Create categories for blog posts and products.
2. Upload media files.
3. Create blog posts.
4. Create products with pricing information.
